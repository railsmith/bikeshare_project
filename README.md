# Bike Sharing API Project

This project is designed to train a machine learning model, build a Python package, run tests, containerize the API using Docker, and push the Docker image to DockerHub. The pipeline is automated using GitHub Actions, providing seamless CI/CD integration for model training, testing, packaging, and deployment.
